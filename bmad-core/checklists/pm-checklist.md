# Product Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development. The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process.

## CHECKLIST PREREQUISITES

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. prd.md - The Product Requirements Document (check docs/prd.md)
2. Any user research, market analysis, or competitive analysis documents
3. Business goals and strategy documents
4. Any existing epic definitions or user stories

IMPORTANT: If the PRD is missing, ask the user for its location or content before proceeding.

## VALIDATION APPROACH

1. User-Centric - Every requirement should tie back to user value
2. MVP Focus - Ensure scope is truly minimal while viable
3. Clarity - Requirements should be unambiguous and testable
4. Completeness - All aspects of the product vision are covered
5. Feasibility - Requirements are technically achievable
