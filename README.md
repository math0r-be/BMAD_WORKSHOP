gemini chat --file .bmad-core/agents/architect.txt  # For system design
gemini chat --file .bmad-core/agents/pm.txt         # For project planning
```

### 1. Start with Clear Objectives

Always begin by explaining your project goals to the agent:

**With Gemini CLI:**
```
# After loading the datadev agent
I need to analyze customer churn data to predict which customers are likely to leave our service.
```

**With other interfaces:**
```
@datadev I need to analyze customer churn data to predict which customers are likely to leave our service.
```

### 2. Iterate and Refine

Use the agents iteratively:

**With Gemini CLI:**
```
*analyze-data
# Review results, then:
Based on the analysis, let's build a classification model
*build-model
```

**With other interfaces:**
```
@datadev *analyze-dataset
# Review results, then:
@datadev Based on the analysis, let's build a classification model
```

### 3. Combine Multiple Agents

Use different agents for different aspects:

```
@architect *design-system  # For overall architecture
@datadev *build-ml-model   # For ML implementation
@qa *test-feature          # For testing strategy
@sm *draft                 # For story breakdown and sprint planning
```

### 4. Agile Data Science Workflow

Data science projects benefit from agile methodology:

```
@sm *draft                 # Break down data science epics into stories
@datadev *analyze-dataset  # Execute data analysis stories
@datadev *build-ml-model   # Implement ML model stories
@sm *correct-course        # Adjust course based on findings
```

### 4. Document Everything

Ask agents to help with documentation:

```
@datadev Create comprehensive documentation for this data pipeline
```

## üèÉ Why Scrum Master is Essential for Data Science

Data science projects are inherently **experimental and iterative**. The Scrum Master (Bob) helps you:

### üéØ **Project Organization**

- **Break down complex data science epics** into manageable stories
- **Define clear acceptance criteria** for data analysis and ML tasks
- **Manage dependencies** between data collection, analysis, modeling, and deployment

### üìã **Sprint Planning for Data Science**

- **Adapt agile methodology** to data science workflows
- **Plan sprints** that account for data exploration uncertainty
- **Balance research tasks** with deliverable outcomes

### üîÑ **Iterative Improvement**

- **Facilitate retrospectives** to improve data science processes
- **Adjust course** when data reveals unexpected insights
- **Coordinate team efforts** across different data science disciplines

### üí° **Practical Example**

```
# Start a data science project with proper organization
@sm *draft
# "I need to build a customer churn prediction model"

# Bob will help you create stories like:
# Story 1: "As a data scientist, I want to explore the customer dataset to understand churn patterns"
# Story 2: "As a data scientist, I want to engineer features that predict customer churn"
# Story 3: "As a data scientist, I want to train and evaluate multiple ML models for churn prediction"
# Story 4: "As a data scientist, I want to deploy the best model to production"

# Then execute each story with TonyFunkman:
@datadev *analyze-dataset    # Execute Story 1
@datadev *build-ml-model     # Execute Story 3
@datadev *deploy-ml-model    # Execute Story 4
```
